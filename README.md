Programming Challenge:

Searchfight<br>
To determine the popularity of programming languages on the internet we want to you to write an application that queries search engines and compares how many results they return, for example:<br>
    C:\> searchfight.exe .net java<br>
    .net: Google: 4450000000 MSN Search: 12354420<br>
    java: Google: 966000000 MSN Search: 94381485<br>
    Google winner: .net<br>
    MSN Search winner: java<br>
    Total winner: .net<br>
    The application should be able to receive a variable amount of words<br>
    The application should support quotation marks to allow searching for terms with spaces (e.g. searchfight.exe “java script”)<br>
    The application should support at least two search engines<br>
